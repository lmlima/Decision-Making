# Decision making algorithms
This repository contains my implementation related to two decision-decision making algorithms:
* [TOPSIS](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/TOPSIS)
* [TODIM](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/TODIM)

In addition, it also contains the framework:
* [A-TOPSIS](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/A-TOPSIS) ([more information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06998))
* [F-TODIM](https://github.com/lmlima/DecisionMaking/tree/master/FTODIM) ([more information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417412006033))

Code based in [Fuzzy Numbers](http://github.com/paaatcha/fuzzy) in order to produce the Fuzzy-TODIM.


All directions are given in the comments in the codes.

If you find any bug, please, email-me.
